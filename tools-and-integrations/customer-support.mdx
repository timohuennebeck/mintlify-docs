<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Crisp account">
        - You can create a new Crisp account [here].
        - Then, create a new website and find the website id which can be found in the integrations menu, in the HTML option. It’s called **CRISP_WEBSITE_ID**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure Crisp in Codebase">
        You’ll just have to paste the `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` inside the `app.config.ts` under websiteId
        and set the isEnabled to true. The codebase will take care of the rest.
    </Step>
