```typescript
import FAQ from "@/components/marketing/FAQ";

<FAQ
    eyebrow="Lorem, ipsum dolor."
    title="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
    tagline="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit."
    items={faq}
/>;
```

**Question Selection**: Address real customer concerns

```typescript
// ❌ Bad Example - Generic questions
items: [{ question: "What is your product?" }, { question: "How does it work?" }];

// ✅ Good Example - Specific concerns
items: [
    { question: "Can I migrate my existing data?" },
    { question: "Do you offer HIPAA compliance?" },
];
```

**Answer Format**: Be concise but complete

```typescript
// ❌ Bad Example - Vague answer
answer: "Yes, we support that";

// ✅ Good Example - Specific answer
answer: "Yes, we support data migration through our API or CSV import. The process typically takes less than 30 minutes.";
```

**Question Order**: Prioritize common questions

```typescript
// ❌ Bad Example - Random order
items: [
    { question: "What's your refund policy?" }, // Important but buried
    { question: "What's your office address?" },
    { question: "How do I get started?" }, // Should be first
];

// ✅ Good Example - Prioritized order
items: [
    { question: "How do I get started?" },
    { question: "What's your refund policy?" },
    { question: "What's your office address?" },
];
```
