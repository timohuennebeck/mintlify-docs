<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone The Boilerplate From GitHub">
        1. To get started, please run the following command to clone the repo from GitHub:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:timohuennebeck/2mrw-boilerplate.git new-project-name
        ```

        2. Upon installing the repo, move into the new project (e.g. new-project-name)

        ```bash
        cd new-project-name
        ```

        3. Let’s now remove the existing remote origin

        ```bash
        git remote remove origin
        ```

        4. You now have to create a new GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/new)

        5. Let’s add the remote URL to our new GitHub repo

        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new-repo.git
        ```

        6. Push the code

        ```bash
        git push -u origin main
        ```

        7. Let’s add the 2mrw (original) boilerplate as upstream (so that we can fetch future updates):

        ```bash
        git remote add upstream git@github.com:timohuennebeck/2mrw-boilerplate.git
        ```

        <Note>
        In order to get future updates from the original boilerplate, use the following commands to fetch and merge the latest changes:
        </Note>

        ```bash
        npm run repo:update
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies">
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Rename .env.example to .env.local">
        You have a `.env.example` file in the root of the codebase. Let’s rename it to `.env.local`.

        You should now have a `.env.local` file with the variables below. That’s it for now. Let’s continue to the configuration files section [here]().

        ```typescript
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
        DEFAULT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
        STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
        STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
        RESEND_API_KEY=
        NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_VERSION=
        ```

        You can now continue with the rest of this guide to set up things such as the database, stripe, resend (emails), etc. to get the app running!
    </Step>

### Project File Structure

Here’s a quick overview of the codebase structure to get ourselves familiar with the boilerplate. Keep in mind that this doesn’t include folders such as `components, app`, etc.

-   `/react-email-starter/` contains email templates

-   `/supabase/` contains supabase edge functions and migration files

-   `/src/middleware.ts` handles middleware (e.g. authentication, etc.).

-   `/src/middleware/handlers` contains various functions and handlers that are used inside the middleware.ts file

-   `/src/app/api/` handles API calls (each route.ts file is one API endpoint).

-   `/src/config/` contains configuration files

-   `/src/enums/` contains enums

-   `/src/interfaces/` contains all interfaces that are not props from a component

-   `/src/lib/qClient/` contains the React Query client configuration

-   `utils/` contains functions such as formatting dates, handling Supabase errors, etc.

-   `/src/services/` contains Supabase client and admin configurations, and centralises database interactions and queries.

    -   `database/` database operations (e.g. HTTP requests, etc.)
    -   `domain/` domain logic
    -   `email/` email service
    -   `integration/` external services such as Supabase, Loops, etc.
    -   `stripe/` Stripe integration
