### Publish To Production

There are a lot of different services to publish a codebase to production. In this guide, we will be using Vercel. For other services, please refer to their corresponding documentation.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Committing Changes">
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Last commit"
        git push
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Creating a Project + Importing (`.env`) Variables">
        INSERT_VIDEO

        <Info>
            The **NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL** should be the URL of your production environment. For instance, for me it would be **https://2mrw.dev** and not **http://localhost:3000**.
        </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Connecting Your Domain">
        This step is not detailed because it varies quite a bit between different hosting providers. For instance, as seen in the video below, we were provided with an **A and CNAME record** that we'll need to add to our domain provider's DNS settings.

    <Step title="Setting Up Stripe For Production">
        Please refer to the Stripe [How To Use Stripe In Production](https://docs.2mrw.dev/configuration/stripe#how-to-use-stripe-in-production) section inside our Stripe setup guide.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Setting Up Google Sign-In For Production">
        Please refer to the Supabase [How To Use Google Sign-In In Production](https://docs.2mrw.dev/configuration/user-authentication#how-to-use-google-sign-in-in-production) section inside our User authentication setup guide.
