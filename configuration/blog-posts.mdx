To create a new blog post, add an `.mdx` file to the `src/content/blog` directory. The post will automatically be rendered on:

-   The blog index page (`src/app/blog`)
-   Individual post pages (`src/app/blog/[slug]`)

## Post Metadata

Each blog post supports the following metadata fields in its frontmatter:

```typescript
---
title: string
description: string
date: string
readTime: string
author: {
    name: string
    role: string
    company: string
    image: string
}
coverImage: string
tag: string
keywords: string[]
---
```

## Creating Content

You can write your post content using standard MDX syntax. MDX supports all standard Markdown features such as headings, bullet points, etc.

<Tip>
    For images and videos, it's recommended to use cloud-hosted URLs rather than including them
    directly in the repository. This helps keep the repository size small and manageable.
