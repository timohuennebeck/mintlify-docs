title: "Configuration Files"
description: "This project comes with a set of configuration files that are used to configure things such as onboarding, emails, etc."
---

Here’s a breakdown of each file and what it’s used for:

#### app.config.ts

You can refer to the `TestimonialSidePanel.tsx`, `Onboarding.tsx`, `FeedbackWidget.tsx` (used for the reportBug and shareFeedback booleans below) and `FormStatusMessage.tsx` components to see what the files inside the app look like.

```javascript
testimonialSidePanel: {
    isEnabled: true, // shows or hides the testimonials side panel
    direction: "right", // the direction of the testimonials side panel
},
```
