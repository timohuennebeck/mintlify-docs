description: "Learn how to set up and use the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline for preview and production environments."

This boilerplate uses a manual approach for the CI/CD pipelines and requires us to merge our changes to the main branch to avoid accidential changes in our production environment.

However, it's also possible to automate all of that using Vercel's build in CI/CD pipeline or using GitHub actions.

### Pre-Requisites

Before getting started, please disable `Branch Tracking` for the `Preview` environment in the Vercel dashboard so that we can avoid automatic deployments.

Please also make sure to assign the appropiate domains to the `Preview (preview.example.com)` and `Production (example.com)` environments.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Push Code to preview">
        ```bash
        git checkout -b preview
        git add .
        git commit -m "last commit"
        git push origin preview
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Preview Build">
        In order to preview the changes, we need to build the preview environment using the following command:

        ```bash
        vercel deploy --target=preview
        ```

        This will trigger a preview build and our preview URL will be assigned to the preview environment (e.g., `preview.example.com`) - which we have defined earlier.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Production Build">
        If the preview environment is working as expected, we can merge the changes to the main branch and run the following command to build the production environment:

        ```bash
        vercel --prod
        ```

        This will trigger a production build and our production URL will be assigned to the production environment (e.g., `example.com`) - which we have defined earlier.
    </Step>

</Steps>

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are configured in both preview and production environments.

The `.env` variables should be the same so that we can test the whole project in the preview environment before switching to production.
