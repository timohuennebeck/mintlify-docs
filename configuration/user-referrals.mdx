Things like sending the appropiate email, creating a referral page have been configured in advance. You just have to enable the `REFERRAL_INVITE` email inside the `email.config.ts` file.

**Here's how it works:**

If a user is on the `app/refer` page and submits the form - the following email will be sent to his friend:

```typescript
await axios.post(postUrl, {
    to: values.email,
    subject: `You've been invited to join ${appConfig.company.name}!`,
    emailType: EmailType.REFERRAL_INVITE,
    variables: {
        nameOfReferrer: dbUser?.email,
        referralCode: dbUser?.referral_code,
    },
});
```

Then, when his friends clicks the link in the email he will redirected to the `auth/sign-up` page which includes the `referralCode` in the URL like so `*/2mrw.dev/auth/sign-up/mode=magic-link:ref=5ZHA81`.

If his friend now signs up with the referral code our `processReferralSignup` fn will be called where we can add some custom code to decide what the friend / or both users should get for a successful referral:

```typescript
export const processReferralSignup = async ({
    newUserId,
    newUserEmail,
    referralCode,
}: ProcessReferralSignupParams) => {
    const { data: existingReferral } = await getExistingReferral(newUserEmail); // check for pending referral (email, password, magic link flow, etc.)

    if (existingReferral) {
        return await updateReferralToCompleted(existingReferral.id, newUserId);
    }

    if (referralCode) {
        const supabase = await createClient(); // if no pending referral but we have a referral code (Google auth flow)

        const { referrer } = await getReferrerByReferralCode(referralCode);

        if (!referrer) {
            return { success: false, error: "The referral code is invalid" };
        }

        const { error: insertError } = await supabase.from("referrals").insert({
            referrer_user_id: referrer.id,
            referred_email: newUserEmail,
            referred_user_id: newUserId,
            status: ReferralStatus.COMPLETED,
        });

        return { success: !insertError, insertError };
    }

    /**
     * FYI: This is the part where you can add new logic to the referral flow such as adding credits to the referrer and the referred users accounts, etc.
     */

    return { success: true };
};
```
