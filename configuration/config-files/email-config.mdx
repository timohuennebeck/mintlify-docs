For emails to work, please connect this boilerplate with Resend. You can refer to the Emails section on how to do this.

Feel free to add or remove emails from the **email.config.ts** file.

```typescript
export const emailConfig: EmailConfigType = {
    [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_STARTED]: {
        component: FreeTrialStartedEmail,
        isEnabled: true,
    },
    [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_EXPIRES_SOON]: {
        component: FreeTrialExpiresEmail,
        isEnabled: true,
    },
    [EmailType.REFERRAL_INVITE]: {
        component: ReferralInviteEmail,
        isEnabled: false,
    },
};
```
