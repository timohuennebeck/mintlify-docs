If an onboarding step is completed it will create a new row in Supabase for the `onboarding_rewards` table to keep track of the tasks the user has completed.

There is no limit on the amount of steps that can be added to the onboarding. Though, I recommend to keep it between 3-4 steps.

It's recommended to just look at the onboarding-checklist.tsx and change some values in the `onboarding.config.ts` to see how the component will change.

```typescript
export const onboardingConfig = {
    title: "Getting Started",
    description: "Finish all onboarding tasks to earn an extra",
    bonusReward: {
        amount: 25,
        unit: "tokens",
    },
    tasks: [
        {
            id: "upload-demo",
            title: "Upload a Product Demo",
            description: "Upload a product demo to get started",
            reward: {
                amount: 2,
                unit: "tokens",
            },
            action: {
                label: "Upload Demo",
                href: "/app/product-demos",
            },
            completionCheck: {
                field: "uploadedProductDemos",
                target: 1,
            },
        },
        {
            id: "invite-friends",
            title: "Invite 5 Friends",
            description: "Invite friends to join the platform",
            reward: {
                amount: 15,
                unit: "tokens per referral",
            },
            action: {
                label: "Invite 5 Friends",
                href: "/app/refer",
            },
            completionCheck: {
                field: "referralCount",
                target: 5,
            },
            multipleSteps: 5, // used if a user needs to complete multiple steps to get the reward, e.g. referring multiple friends
            disableRewardForMultipleSteps: true,
        },
    ],
} as const satisfies OnboardingConfig; // uses satisfies as we otherwise can't use as const type assertion
```

You can then pass down the values for the `completionCheck.field` we declared in our `onboarding.config.ts` which will then check if the condition has been met.

```jsx
<OnboardingChecklistTrigger
    userProgress={{ uploadedProductDemos: productDemos.length, referralCount: referrals.length }}
    config={onboardingConfig}
    onClaimBonus={...}
    isClaimingBonus={...}
/>
```
