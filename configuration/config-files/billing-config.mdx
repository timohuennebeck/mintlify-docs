```typescript
isFreePlanEnabled: true, // this will be overridden when ONE_TIME is enabled
billingPlan: BillingPlan.ONE_TIME, // choose between ONE_TIME or RECURRING
```

```typescript
freeTrial: {
    isEnabled: true, // shows or hides the free trial
    duration: 14, // the duration of the free trial
},
```

<Warning>
    If OTP is enabled, the free plan as well as the free trial will be disabled as it’s not common
    to have a free plan / free trial with a OTP.
</Warning>

<Note>
**To-Do’s:**

-   Set billingPlan to either BillingPlan.ONE_TIME (for OTPs) or BillingPlan.RECURRING (for recurring subscriptions).
-   If recurring subscriptions are enabled, set other values such as the freeTrial duration and isFreePlanEnabled, etc.
