This project comes with a set of data files that are used to populate the data for the **Landing Page**, including things such as testimonials, features, pricing, etc.

In order to launch the landing page, we'll just have to replace the **Lorem Ipsum** with our actual content. Here's a breakdown of each file and what it's used for:

### features-data.ts

This file contains the data for each of the features in the `Features.tsx` component — the three ones shown at the bottom of the page.
