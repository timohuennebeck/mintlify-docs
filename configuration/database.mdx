### Supabase (.env) Setup

<Note>
    Pre-Requirements: Have a Supabase account with a project. Otherwise, feel free to create a new
    project [here] before continuing.
</Note>

In order for our boilerplate to have all the required environment variables, we need to set them up in the `.env` file.

You need to get the following variables from Supabase: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `DEFAULT_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

### Supabase Table Setup

Letâ€™s now create all the required tables for this boilerplate to handle things such as user data, subscriptions, free trials, etc. - using the Supabase SQL Editor:

Inside the codebase, go to `create_tables.sql` and paste its data inside the Supabase SQL Editor which can be found in the dashboard.
