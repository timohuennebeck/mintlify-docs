FYI: You can also add or remove existing emails with the `email.config.ts`.

### Prerequisites

Before customising our emails, please make sure to replace the logo URL in the emails. You can use a tool like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) to host the image and then use the URL in the emails.

### Setting Up Resend

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating a Resend account">
        You can sign up for a free account at [Resend](https://resend.com/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup SMTP in Supabase">
        Please refer to the [Resend SMTP](https://resend.com/changelog/supabase-integration)
        documentation to learn more about how to set up Resend SMTP in Supabase.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setting up Supabase Emails">
        Supabase has a set of built-in emails that are used for various purposes such as sign up, email confirmation, etc.

        1. Download all the email templates [here]() required for the Supabase Emails, e.g., Confirm Email Change, Password Reset, etc.
        2. Paste each email into its corresponding email template which can be found in the dashboard under authentication -> email templates

        In order for the authentication to work we need to use a `token_hash` inside the URL. Here are the paths for each email.

        <Note>
        This step isn't required if the emails have been downloaded and copied as mentioned in the previous step. This is just an FYI of how it works.
        </Note>

        For the **Confirm Signup** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup
        ```

        For the **Magic Link** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=magiclink
        ```

        For the **Change Email Address** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email_change
        ```

        For the **Reset Password** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setting Up Custom Transactional Emails (Optional)">
        <Note>
            This boilerplate comes with a set of custom transactional emails that are used for various purposes including: free trial started, free trial expires soon and referral invites.

            FYI: Including these custom transactional emails is optional but provides a more pleasant user experience.
        </Note>

        In this step, weâ€™ll have to create various transactional emails based on the email.config.ts file.

        Inside our `email.config.ts` enable or disable the desired emails. That's it.

        ```typescript
        export const emailConfig: EmailConfigType = {
            [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_STARTED]: {
                component: FreeTrialStartedEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
            [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_EXPIRES_SOON]: {
                component: FreeTrialExpiresEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
            [EmailType.REFERRAL_INVITE]: {
                component: ReferralInviteEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
        };
        ```

        This boilerplate uses React Email under the hood for the emails. Thus, all emails can be further customised if desired.

        ```bash
        cd react-email-starter && npm run dev
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
