FYI: You can also add or remove existing emails with the `email.config.ts`.

### Prerequisites

Before customising our emails, please make sure to replace the `[INSERT_LOGO_URL]` and `[INSERT_COMPANY_NAME]` in the emails. You can use a tool like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) to host the image and then use the URL in the emails.

### Setting Up Resend

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating a Resend account">
        You can sign up for a free account at [Resend](https://resend.com/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup SMTP in Supabase">
        Please refer to the [Resend SMTP](https://resend.com/changelog/supabase-integration)
        documentation to learn more about how to set up Resend SMTP in Supabase.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setting up Supabase Emails">
        Supabase has a set of built-in emails that are used for various purposes such as sign up, email confirmation, etc.

        1. Download all the email templates [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/314ez5cz07jxd9a171y1a/supabase-emails.zip?rlkey=rxk4fxiq1ls208ior6mcut6zk&st=2wnypinv&raw=1) required for the Supabase Emails, e.g., Confirm Email Change, Password Reset, etc.
        2. Paste each email into its corresponding email template which can be found in the Supabase dashboard under Email Templates

        In order for the authentication to work we need to use a `token_hash` inside the URL. Here are the paths for each email.

        <Note>
        This step isn't required if the emails have been downloaded and copied as mentioned in the previous step. This is just an FYI of how it works.
        </Note>

        For the **Confirm Signup** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup
        ```

        For the **Magic Link** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=magiclink
        ```

        For the **Change Email Address** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email_change
        ```

        For the **Reset Password** email, we need to use the following path:

        ```typescript
        {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setting Up Custom Transactional Emails (Optional)">
        <Note>
            This boilerplate comes with a set of custom transactional emails that are used for various purposes including: free trial started, free trial expires soon and referral invites.

            FYI: Including these custom transactional emails is optional but provides a more pleasant user experience.
        </Note>

        In this step, weâ€™ll have to create various transactional emails based on the email.config.ts file.

        Inside our `email.config.ts` enable or disable the desired emails. That's it.

        ```typescript
        export const emailConfig: EmailConfigType = {
            [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_STARTED]: {
                component: FreeTrialStartedEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
            [EmailType.FREE_TRIAL_EXPIRES_SOON]: {
                component: FreeTrialExpiresEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
            [EmailType.REFERRAL_INVITE]: {
                component: ReferralInviteEmail,
                isEnabled: false,
            },
        };
        ```

        This boilerplate uses React Email under the hood for the emails. Thus, all emails can be further customised if desired.

        ```bash
        cd react-email-starter && npm run dev
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
