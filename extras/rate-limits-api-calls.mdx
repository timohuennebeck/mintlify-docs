    title: "Rate Limits (API Calls)"
    description: "For plans that introduce a rate limit (e.g. allowing a user to upload 50 files per month), it's recommended to limit the number of API calls a user can perform in a given time frame based on their IP address. In this example, we'll be limiting it to 5 API calls per minute using Upstash."

<Info>
    You can find an example of how the `middleware.ts` file should look like at the end of this
    page.
</Info>

1. You can create a new Upstash account [here](https://console.upstash.com/login).

2. Create a Redis database.

3. In the details section of the dashboard, get the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.

4. Let's now update the following variables inside the `.env.local` in the codebase:

```typescript
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=
```

In the codebase, run the following command to install the @upstash/ratelimit package:

```bash
npm install @upstash/redis @upstash/ratelimit
```

In the middleware.ts file, add an RATE_LIMITED_URLS arr outside of the middleware function. This arr contains the URLs that will be rate limited.

```typescript
const RATE_LIMITED_URLS = ["/api/example-call"];
```

Then, initialise the redis client with the .env variables we just copied:

```typescript
const redis = new Redis({
    url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
    token: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
});
```

You can now add the rateLimit outside of the middleware function. In our case, we'll be limiting it to 5 API calls per minute (60 seconds). If a user makes more than 5 API calls in a minute, a 429 response will be returned.

```typescript
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
    redis: redis,
    limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(5, "60 s"),
});
```

You'll just have to add this if statement to check if the URL is rate limited and return the appropriate response and then we're done.

```typescript
if (RATE_LIMITED_URLS.some((url) => request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(url))) {
    const ip = request.ip ?? "127.0.0.1";
    const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);

    if (!success) {
        return new NextResponse("Too Many Requests", { status: 429 });
    }
}
```

<Note>
    Please add this if statement inside the middleware function BUT before the
    `supabaseClient.auth.getUser()` function. Otherwise, the rate limit will not work as it will be
    executed after all the API calls have been made.
</Note>

Here's an example of how the middleware.ts file should look like:

```typescript
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";

const RATE_LIMITED_URLS = ["/api/example-call"];

...

const redis = new Redis({
url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
token: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN,
});

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
redis: redis,
limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(5, "60 s"),
});

export const middleware = async (request: Request) => {
    ...

    if (RATE_LIMITED_URLS.some((url) => request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(url))) {
        const ip = request.ip ?? "127.0.0.1";
        const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(ip);

        if (!success) {
            return new NextResponse("Too Many Requests", { status: 429 });
        }
    }

    const supabaseClient = createServerClient(
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
            {
                cookies: {...},
            },
        );

    ...

};
```
